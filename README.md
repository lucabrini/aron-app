# Aron app
This PWA allows the teachers of my musical Institute to keep track of student's lessons and to manage them individually

## Tech stack
* SvelteKit
* TailwindCSS
* PocketBase as a Backend
* Typescript

## Additional notes
PWA was choice instead of a native app in order to achieve the following customer needs:
* App needs to run on both iOS and Android
* Avoid publishing on native's app stores
* Updates transparency
